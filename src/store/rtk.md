# Redux Tool Kit (RTK) Query

RTK Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

It is included in the Redux Toolkit package, and its functionality is built on top of the other APIs in Redux Toolkit.

> Basically, it combines methods like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk` to create a one-stop solution to loading and handling states
