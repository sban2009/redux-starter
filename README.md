# redux-starter

 Redux starter project with both Redux and Redux Toolkit starter code. No frontend.

- [Redux](src/store-redux/)
- [Redux Toolkit](src/store-redux-toolkit/)
- [RTK Query](src/store)

> RTK Query is simply a wrapper over RTK (Redux ToolKit) which is, in turn, a wrapper over vanilla Redux

Run `npm start` to start the project and navigate to <http://localhost:8001/>
